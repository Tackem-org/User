# Tackem User
User Service For Tackem System

## Folders to Mount
- /config
- /log

## TODO
- need to make an option to allow the user to request or change there username two options two permissions
  - Work left for a permissioned user to allow or reject user name change requests.
    - This will need a new system of panels that can go onto multiple pages
    - an activities dropdown box that will be able to check the count. will need to find a way of communicating into this websocket from other systems to update the count number so it will dynamically update itself. going to need a root websocket to deal with this stuff

- Normal user systems <- working on with above fix first
  - need to allow the user to pick an Icon and look at making the Icon folder a special folder

## Future
- look at rules for allowed password too.
- possably need to add in an email field for comunications to a user through email. this will then need some form of list of allowed emails to recieve
## Using
- <https://gorm.io/>
