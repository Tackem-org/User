# Tackem User
User System For Tackem System

## TODO
- start work on this system making it use sqllite but behind an interface so we can use any other storage we want.
- Include a group system that pages can register new groups
- Groups and individual users should be able to inheret permissions for "actions"/pages (and eventually API too.) API will be a copy of the Remote Web system but will be more spaced around nly serving json data and will need to take methods into account more.

## Using
- <https://gorm.io/>
