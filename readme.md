## TODO
- change the admin user edit websocket to update the model rather than using save. https://gorm.io/docs/update.html
- Make the minimum password length an option and possaby look at rules for allowed password too.

- Normal user systems <- working on with above fix first
  - need to allow the user to pick an Icon and look at making the Icon folder a special folder
